    "# Demo story\n",
    "\n",
    "out of all the possible events that can give rise to an infinite number of chains, we are just simulating and demoing just one chain : delay, crew legality, substitution, repositioning, hotel/transport, policy fallback\n",
    "\n",
    "delay → legality check → substitution → repositioning → hotel/transport → policy fallback\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event 1: \"UA123 delayed 90 min\"\n",
    "- Event 2: \"UA123 delay increases to 210 min\"\n",
    "- Event 3: \"SFO spare crew found\"\n",
    "- Event 4: \"SFO fog — reposition flight canceled\"\n",
    "- Event 5: \"DEN crew identified\"\n",
    "- Event 6: \"No reposition flight from DEN\"\n",
    "- Event 7: \"Hotel at ORD overbooked\"\n",
    "- Event 8: \"Alternative hotel secured + notifications sent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The core of the simulation is **time-driven flight status data**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You will create a mock flight schedule where:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Flights have planned departure and arrival times.\n",
    "- As the simulation clock advances, some flights develop delays (you modify delay_minutes dynamically as part of the data update).\n",
    "- These updates happen independently of any direct agent involvement — the agent only sees the changed data when it queries.\n",
    "1. The agent’s job is to **continuously monitor the flight data**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    At each clock tick:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The agent queries flight status for flights under its watch.\n",
    "- The agent notices delay or disruption based on the current data state, not because an external event handed it that knowledge.\n",
    "1. Other data (crew roster, hotel, repositioning options) is mostly static but still queried as needed.\n",
    "- Crew data defines duty limits, assigned flights, qualifications.\n",
    "- Hotel and reposition flight data could also change (for realism) but are not monitored continuously; they are checked when the agent’s reasoning requires.\n",
    "1. The clock powers the data simulation:\n",
    "- The clock advances simulated time (could be 1 minute per loop or whatever scale works for demo).\n",
    "- A separate data update function updates flight delay fields as time advances. For example, after 10 ticks, flight UA123’s delay_minutes field is updated to 90. After 20 ticks, it’s 210.\n",
    "- The agent doesn’t know these thresholds. It just keeps querying flight data and decides when action is needed.\n",
    "1. There’s no artificial event queue like “fog at SFO” for the agent to process.\n",
    "- All the agent sees is that repositioning flight from SFO is delayed or unavailable when it queries.\n",
    "- The cause (fog) is irrelevant to the agent’s reasoning in this case."

    "- Scope: Gather and summarize current state.\n",
    "- Examples: Flight status agent, crew status agent, weather condition agent.\n",
    "- Purpose: Provide situational awareness, inform other agents' decisions.\n",
    "- Nature: Passive/reactive, no direct action beyond informing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ **Action Executor Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scope: Carry out specific operational tasks or commands.\n",
    "- Examples: Crew assigner, hotel booker, transport arranger, communicator.\n",
    "- Purpose: Translate decisions into changes in the world or system state.\n",
    "- Nature: Active/doers, often invoked by reasoning agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ **Rule Evaluator Agents**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scope: Check compliance with legal, contractual, or operational rules.\n",
    "- Examples: Duty legality checker, qualification checker, policy retriever.\n",
    "- Purpose: Gatekeeper for valid actions, ensure plans follow rules.\n",
    "- Nature: Deciders/validators.\n",
